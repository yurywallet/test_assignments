# Task
Create a PDF parser for legal contracts

Company needs a NLP/ML module to understand regular contracts (name, start date, end date, conditions, tax rates, etc.). 
The module needs to automatically fetch as much data as possible and for the data itâ€™s unsure of, it has to understand the approximate location 
of the data on the PDF and point the user to it.
