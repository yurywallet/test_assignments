# Position

# Task
Attached file (Credit_offer.csv) contains information on received loan applications and credit offers made to the customer. 
Note that credit offer is made after receiving the loan application and it may differ from loan application in amount or term due to product 
or credit policy constraints.

Your task is to understand customer behavior (credit offer acceptance and re-applications) and find out whether there are different patterns in this behavior. 
Please, present your main findings as if your target audience was marketing team, product owner and credit risk manager.
