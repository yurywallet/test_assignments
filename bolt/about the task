Important part of our business is a supply/demand balance. 
We can’t control demand but we can shift some supply to necessary hours to cover more demand during peaks.

As part of the task you will have sample supply and demand data over a few weeks in a single city a few weeks after launch.

We need to understand:
1)	What is the supply to demand dynamic and whether they match?
2)	Where are the hours of oversupply? Can we shift some of them to undersupply hours?

Needed output:
1.	Show which 36 hours in a week are most undersupplied. Show/describe your decision based on sample data.
2.	24-hour curve of average supply and demand (to illustrate match/mismatch).
3.	Visualisation of hours where we lack supply during a weekly period. This one we can send to drivers to show when to online for extra hours.
4.	Estimate number of hours needed to ensure we have a high Coverage Ratio during most peak hours.
5.	Calculate levels of guaranteed hourly earnings we can offer to drivers during 36 weekly hours with highest demand without losing money + how much extra hours we want to get to capture missed demand.
  a.	Assume that Finished Rides have an average value of €10 (80% goes to driver, 20% is our revenue).
  b.	Assume the same level of demand with increased supply, base it on RPH over 3 hour periods, but with increased supply.
  c.	Assume that with extra hours we will capture “missed coverage” or people attributed to “People saw 0 cars” in demand data.
