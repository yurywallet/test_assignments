# Position
- Senior Marketing Analyst

# Task

# Data: 
Transactional data

# Questions to answer:
1. Looking at the data, which customers would you deem risky based on their behaviour?

  a) Try to show through data and clear visualization strange behaviour that you think
  is worth further monitoring.
  
  b) Based on that data, what kind of limits/restrictions would you set to catch any
  potential bad customers before they manage to do any harm? Show how our customers would
  be impacted by these limits and hypothesize the likely behaviour models that would emerge from
  the change.

2. What kind of info would you like to acquire from/about these customers in order to trust
our service to them or deny it? How would you go about getting this info?
